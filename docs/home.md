2. [Flag race](./flag)

   - We're looking for 100 points (just a clear), but we would highly appreciate anything more than the minimum.

3. Weekly Mission Points
   - **1 point every 5,000 mobs killed** or **1 point every 80 boss points**

    **1 weekly mission point is required to enter flag race**.
    These points can be acquired by either killing monsters (5K per WMP) or doing weekly bosses (80 boss points per WMP).
    Clearing CZak, HMag, HHilla, and CRA should net enough boss points for 1 WMP.
