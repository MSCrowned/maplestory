# Flag Race

Flag race is a jump quest where you clear 3 laps within the 8 minute time limit to get points for your guild for the **week**.
The amount of points you get is determined by how quickly you can finish all 3 laps.
Information regarding the flag race skills and scoring can be found [here](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/MapleStory/Flag_Race#Flag_Race_Skills).

The jump quest cycles each weekly reset (Monday 12:00 AM UTC) between 3 maps:
1. Daylight Snowfield
2. Sunset Snowfield
3. Night Snowfield

:::caution

These points can be acquired by either **killing 1,000 monsters** or **weekly bosses until you have accrued 40 boss points**.

Entries for Flag Race are disabled on **Sunday 11:00 PM UTC to Monday 1:00 AM UTC**.
