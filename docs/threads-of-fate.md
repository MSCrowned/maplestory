# Threads of Fate

This mechanic is mainly used to get Suspicious Herb Pouches ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2431233/icon) or Mineral Pouches ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2431232/icon).

From the herb pouches ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2431233/icon), you can get crafting materials like Juniper Berry Seed Oils ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/4023019/icon) which are used to craft Wealth Acquisition Potions ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2003551/icon) and EXP Acculumation Potions ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2003550/icon). You can also get materials to make stat pills with.

From the mineral pouches ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2431232/icon), you can get crafting materials which are useful for levelling up your Smithing/Accessory Crafting profession.

## Opening Threads of Fate

1. Click the white lightbulb on the left hand side
2. Select `[Threads of Fate] Unravelling the Threads of Fate`
   1. Clicking `My Level Range` the bottom right will reduce the amount of quests displayed

## Prerequisites

1. Unlock at least 2 NPCs ([Pre-quest guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/p574l9/threads_of_fate_summarized_questline/))
2. Have at least 2 NPCs unlocked both with 70 closeness
   1. Personally, I recommend Takeno and Kurama as their gift items are easy to obtain (Elixirs and Arrows)

## How To Obtain The Right `Ask`

The way your `Ask` resets is that at the first `Ask` that is started with any NPC will cause the trigger for the reset.
This means that if you had something like "Go Dig" as your `Ask` for NPC A prior to reset, then after reset if you start another `Ask` with them again then the `Ask` will change to something else and then be displayed in the dialogue.
So to roll for the correct `Ask` the process is:
1. After reset, start the first `Ask` of the reset period with any of the NPCs.
   1. If it doesn't roll the correct `Ask`, then repeat Step 1 again.
   2. If it rolls the correct `Ask`, then you're done and you can spam it for the rest of this reset period.

:::caution

Read the next section, to continue being able to easily spam `Ask` while retaining your `Ask` beyond each reset.

## How To Spam `Ask`

As of v235, the current way to spam `Ask` without triggering the reset is:
1. After reset, start an `Ask` with the NPC that does not have the right `Ask`.
   1. This will trigger the reset on that NPC
2. Log out
3. Start an `Ask` with the NPC that has the right `Ask`.
4.  Do your 5 desired `Ask`

:::danger

Do **NOT** change channels, go into Cash Shop, or do anything that will change you channel from the one you started your `Ask` on. If you do, then your reward will go from whatever you wanted to mesos instead.

## Closeness

[Wiki page](https://maplestory.fandom.com/wiki/Epic/Mushroom_Shrine_Tales#Threads_of_Fate)

Closeness determines the quantity of the rewards you receive. For the pouches, you can get 1 pouch per 5 closeness of the NPC you `Ask`. Closeness maxes out at 100, so the maximum amount of pouches you can get per `Ask` is 20.

Closeness per NPC [decays weekly on Monday 12:00 AM UTC](https://maplestory.nexon.net/news/65824/v-221-spring-blossoms-patch-notes).
   1. 70+ closeness: 15 points will be reduced
   2. 50 ~ 69 closeness: 10 points will be reduced
   3. Below 50 closeness: 5 points will be reduced

Increasing Closeness
   - `Talk` option with an NPC
     - None of the options matter as they all give +2 closeness now
     - Has a 30 minute cooldown per NPC
     - Does **not** raise closeness when closeness is >= 50
   - `Gift` option with an NPC
     - You can only gift each NPC 7 times per week (+21 closeness weekly)
     - [Each NPC has a certain set of items they want](https://maplestory.fandom.com/wiki/Epic/Mushroom_Shrine_Tales#Threads_of_Fate)
       - Easy gifts: Takeno, Tengu, Nue, Yorozu, Kurama, Izuna, and Ibaraki
       - Not as easy gifts: Kino, Kubinashi, and Kamaitachi
   - Kill the Showa boss for the Threads of Fate ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2632261/icon)
     - This is a daily +7 closeness to your NPC of choice
