# Flag Race

Flag race is a jump quest where you clear 3 laps within the 8 minute time limit to get points for your guild for the **week**.
The amount of points you get is determined by how quickly you can finish all 3 laps.
Information regarding the flag race skills and scoring can be found [here](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/MapleStory/Flag_Race#Flag_Race_Skills).

The jump quest cycles each weekly reset (Monday 12:00 AM UTC) between 3 maps:
1. Daylight Snowfield
2. Sunset Snowfield
3. Night Snowfield

:::caution

**1 weekly mission point is required to enter flag race**.
These points can be acquired by either killing monsters (5K per WMP) or doing weekly bosses (80 boss points per WMP).
Clearing CZak, HMag, HHilla, and CRA should net enough boss points for 1 WMP.

Entries for Flag Race are disabled on **Sunday 11:00 PM UTC to Monday 1:00 AM UTC**.
