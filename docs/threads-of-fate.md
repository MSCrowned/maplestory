# Threads of Fate

This mechanic is mainly used to get Suspicious Herb Pouches ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2431233/icon) or Mineral Pouches ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2431232/icon).

From the herb pouches ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2431233/icon), you can get crafting materials like Juniper Berry Seed Oils ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/4023019/icon) which are used to craft Wealth Acquisition Potions ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2003551/icon) and EXP Acculumation Potions ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2003550/icon). You can also get materials to make stat pills with.

From the mineral pouches ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2431232/icon), you can get crafting materials which are useful for levelling up your Smithing/Accessory Crafting profession.

## Opening Threads of Fate

1. Click the white lightbulb on the left hand side
2. Select `[Threads of Fate] Unravelling the Threads of Fate`
   1. Clicking `My Level Range` the bottom right will reduce the amount of quests displayed

## Ask Method

As of v229, the current way to spam `Ask` for repeated rewards is to:
1. Have 2 NPCs unlocked
   1. Throwaway NPC - can have any `Ask` option
   2. Desired NPC - should have your desired `Ask` option
2. Go to Penguin Port in Rein
3. Open the Threads of Fate UI
4. Talk to Puro and select the first option to go to the theme dungeon
   1. You'll be put on a boat ride
5. Open up the `Ask` for your throwaway NPC, **BUT DO NOT CLICK THE ACTUAL ASK OPTION**
6. Wait for the boat ride to end
7.  Do your 5 desired `Ask`
   :::danger

   Do **NOT** change channels, go into Cash Shop, or do anything that will change you channel from the one you started your `Ask` on. If you do, then your reward will go from whatever you wanted to mesos instead.

## Closeness

[Wiki page](https://maplestory.fandom.com/wiki/Epic/Mushroom_Shrine_Tales#Threads_of_Fate)

Closeness determines the quantity of the rewards you receive. For the pouches, you can get 1 pouch per 5 closeness of the NPC you `Ask`. Closeness maxes out at 100, so the maximum amount of pouches you can get per `Ask` is 20.

Closeness per NPC [decays weekly on Monday 12:00 AM UTC](https://maplestory.nexon.net/news/65824/v-221-spring-blossoms-patch-notes).
   1. 70+ closeness: 15 points will be reduced
   2. 50 ~ 69 closeness: 10 points will be reduced
   3. Below 50 closeness: 5 points will be reduced

Increasing Closeness
   - `Talk`
     - None of the options matter as they all give +2 closeness now
     - Has a 30 minute cooldown per NPC
     - Does **not** raise closeness when closeness is >= 50
   - `Gift` an NPC
     - You can only gift each NPC 7 times per week (+21 closeness weekly)
     - [Each NPC has a certain set of items they want](https://maplestory.fandom.com/wiki/Epic/Mushroom_Shrine_Tales#Threads_of_Fate)
