# Threads of Fate

This mechanic is mainly used to get Suspicious Herb Pouches ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2431233/icon) or Mineral Pouches ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2431232/icon).

From the herb pouches ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2431233/icon), you can get crafting materials like Juniper Berry Seed Oils ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/4023019/icon) which are used to craft Wealth Acquisition Potions ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2003551/icon) and EXP Acculumation Potions ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2003550/icon). You also get materials to make stat pills with.

From the mineral pouches ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2431232/icon), you can get crafting materials which are useful for levelling up your Smithing/Accessory Crafting profession.

## Opening Threads of Fate

1. Click the white lightbulb on the left hand side
2. Select `[Threads of Fate] Unravelling the Threads of Fate`
   1. You can also click the `My Level Range` button on the bottom right of the dialogue window to reduce the amount of quests displayed

## Ask Method

As of v229, the current way to spam "Ask" for repeated rewards is to:
1. Have 2 NPCs unlocked
   1. Throwaway "Ask" NPC - can have any "Ask" option
   2. Desired "Ask" NPC - should have your desired "Ask" option
2. Start your first "Ask" of the reset cycle with the throwaway NPC
   1. Wait the 30 minutes and claim the reward from the lightbulb.
3. Complete the other four "Ask" with the desired NPC
   :::danger

   Do **NOT** change channels, go into Cash Shop, or do anything that will change you channel from the one you started your "Ask" on. If you do, then your reward will go from whatever you wanted to mesos instead.

4. Repeat next reset

## Closeness

[Wiki page](https://maplestory.fandom.com/wiki/Epic/Mushroom_Shrine_Tales#Threads_of_Fate)

Closeness determines the quantity of the rewards you receive. For the pouches, you can get 1 pouch per 5 closeness of the NPC you "Ask". Closeness maxes out at 100, so the maximum amount of pouches you can get per "Ask" is 20.

Closeness per NPC [decays weekly on Monday 12:00 AM UTC](https://maplestory.nexon.net/news/65824/v-221-spring-blossoms-patch-notes).
   1. 70+ closeness: 15 points will be reduced
   2. 50 ~ 69 closeness: 10 points will be reduced
   3. Below 50 closeness: 5 points will be reduced

Increasing Closeness
   - "Talk" to 50 closeness
     - None of the options matter as they all give +2 closeness now
     - Has a 30 minute cooldown per NPC
   - "Gift" an NPC to 100 closeness
     - Weekly +21 closeness
       - Eventually, you'll just use "Gift" to maintain max closeness for all the NPCs you have on the board
     - [Each NPC has a certain set of items they want](https://maplestory.fandom.com/wiki/Epic/Mushroom_Shrine_Tales#Threads_of_Fate)
       - I would only do Takeno, Tengu, Nue, Yorozu, Kurama, Izuna, and Ibaraki, since the others take more effort to maintain 100 closeness with only gifting
   - Kill the Showa boss for the Threads of Fate ![](https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/228/item/2632261/icon) to 100 closeness
     - This is a daily +7 closeness to your NPC of choice
